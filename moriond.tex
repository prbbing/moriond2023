\title{Highlights of ATLAS Search Results}

\author{Bingxuan Liu, on behalf of the ATLAS Collaboration}

\address{Department of Physics, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Canada}

\maketitle\abstracts{Searching for beyond standard model (BSM) physics has been
one of the primary goals of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics program.
The LHC delivered 140 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ data of high quality in Run 2,
allowing both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations to expand and improve their
search programs. The recent development in detector perforamnce and analysis
techniques have brought significant boosts to the search sensitivities. In this
article, highlights of recent ATLAS search results are discussed and
summarized.}  

\section{Introduction}

Many mysteries in particle physics, such as the hierarchy problem, the origin
of dark matter (DM) and neutrino masses are still waiting for answers or hints
from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). ATLAS is a general purpose detector at
the LHC that is capable of searching for beyond standard model (BSM) physics
via various approaches. ATLAS has conducted a comprehensive set of searches in
the past years, excluding the majority part of the phase space. As a
consequence, recent ATLAS searches are featured with applying cutting-edge
analysis techniques or detector performance development, filling the gaps
between explored regions of phase space and considering challenging, completely
uncovered signatures.      

\section{Full Run 2 Upgrades}

The detector performance in ATLAS is continuously improving, thanks to the
diligent work carried out in the relevant areas. For instance, the performance
of bottom- and top-tagging has advance significantly in the past few years. In
addition, the application of machine learning techniques have become very
mature in physics analyses, enhancing the sensitivities. Even though previous
analyses have explored similar final states, taking advantage of the above
facts and more data, the full Run 2 upgrades of the those searches will push
the exclusion limits further.\\

In the full Run 2 ATLAS vector-like quark search, the top partner masses with
50\% decay width are excluded up to 1975 GeV for the singlet representation,
considering $B(T\rightarrow Wb)=0.5$, as shown in
Figure (~\ref{fig:limits1}~\subref{fig:vlq}). Compared to the previous analysis
probing the same final state, this analysis adopted an updated top-tagger and
more optimized selections, achieving greatly improved exclusion limits. The
ATLAS full Run 2 right-handed neutrino search sets the most stringent limits on
the Keung-SenjanoviÄ‡ process in the TeV $W$ partner ($W_{\mathrm{R}}$) mass
region. This search considers both the ``resolved'' and ``merged'' cases,
depending on the mass split between the $W_{\mathrm{R}}$ and the heavy neutrino
($N_{\mathrm{R}}$). For Majorana neutrinos, in the muon channel, the limit on
$m(W_{\mathrm{R}})$ reaches 6.4 TeV for $m(N_{\mathrm{R}})=1$ TeV, and the
limit on $m(N_{\mathrm{R}})$ extends to 3.6 teV for $m(W_{\mathrm{R}})=4.8$
TeV, as shown in Figure (~\ref{fig:limits1}~\subref{fig:rhn}).

\section{Filling the Gap}

There have been many BSM models proposed by the theory community in the past
decades. The number of free parameters in those models is so vastly large that
a single search can only probe a subset of the parameter space, a particular
combination of masses and couplings. Naturally, there are gap between exisitng
searches, and they need to be explored. The gap regions are usually hard to
probe so that special analysis strategies are essential.\\

Supersymmetry has been explored extensively at the LHC by a comprehensive
program. However various uncovered corners have been present on specific
parameter planes. A recent ATLAS search for higgsino considers the
$b\overline{b}\gamma\gamma$ final state, successfully filling the gap in the
low mass region, as seen in Figure (~\ref{fig:limits2}~\subref{fig:bbyy}). It
takes advantage of the excellent mass resolution of the photons and the large
$H\rightarrow b\overline{b}$ branching ratio.\\ 

The gap between dedicated long-lived particle (LLP) searches and conventional
searches is becoming increasingly important. The recent ATLAS search for
micro-displaced muons opened a new avenue to cover this region. This search
uses muons reconstructed by the standard algorithms, but the impact parameter
($|d_{0}|$) of the muons are required to be between 0.1 and 3 mm. Control
regions, validation regions, and signal regions are constructed using the muon
$|d_{0}|$ and muon-pair mass. In the context of a smuon pair production, the
smuon lifetimes down to 1 $ps$ and smuon masses up to 520 GeV are excluded,
shown in Figure (~\ref{fig:limits2}~\subref{fig:micro}).\\
